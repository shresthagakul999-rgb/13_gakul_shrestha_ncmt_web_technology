QN 1
Planning is the most critical phase of web development because it sets the foundation for the entire project. Proper planning ensures smooth development, reduces risks, and leads to a successful website. Errors at this stage can lead to redesign, increased cost, and time wastage later.
The key activities performed during the planning phase are:
Defining project goals and objectives – identifying the purpose of the website.
Target audience analysis – understanding users’ needs, preferences, and behavior.
Content planning – deciding what content (text, images, videos) will be included.
Creating sitemap and wireframes – organizing website structure and layout.
Technology selection – choosing tools, languages, frameworks, and hosting.
Time and budget estimation – planning schedules and cost allocation.

QN 2
The maintenance phase is iterative because it involves continuous improvement after the website is launched. A website is never truly “finished” because user needs, technologies, and business goals keep changing.
Key reasons include:
Regular content updates to keep information current.
Bug fixing and performance optimization based on user feedback.
Security updates to protect against new threats.
Compatibility updates for new devices and browsers.
Feature enhancements based on user demand.
SEO and analytics improvements to improve visibility and performance.
Thus, maintenance is an ongoing cycle that ensures the website remains functional, secure, and relevant.

QN 3
Information Gathering is the first and one of the most important steps in the web development process. It involves collecting all necessary information about the project to ensure the website meets its goals and user expectations.
The process includes several activities:
Identifying the purpose and objectives: Understanding why the website is being created and what it aims to achieve (e.g., selling products, providing information, or promoting services).
Client and stakeholder consultation: Meeting with clients to gather their requirements, expectations, and ideas for the website.
Research and analysis: Studying competitors’ websites, industry trends, and best practices to identify opportunities and challenges.
Content collection: Determining what type of content will be needed, including text, images, videos, and documents.
Technical requirement analysis: Identifying software, hardware, hosting, and other technical considerations required for development.
Defining target users: Analyzing demographics, interests, preferences, and needs of the potential audience.
Setting success criteria: Establishing how the website’s performance and effectiveness will be measured after launch.

Importance of understanding the target audience:
Knowing the audience helps in designing user-friendly navigation and layouts that are intuitive.
It ensures content relevance, so visitors find the information or services they are looking for.
Helps in selecting the right visuals, language, and features to engage users effectively.
Supports better marketing and communication strategies, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.
Reduces the risk of developing a website that does not meet user expectations, saving time and cost.

In short, thorough information gathering, combined with a deep understanding of the target audience, ensures that the website is effective, user-centric, and aligned with business goals, forming a strong foundation for successful development.
